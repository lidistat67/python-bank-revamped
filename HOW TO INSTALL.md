Hello and thank you for downloading python bank. In order to use python bank You need to have downloaded python which can be found here https://www.python.org/downloads/.
After downloading python open command prompt (cmd) and run: python --version. If this returns Python x.x.x then it means that python has been sucessfully downloaded. In case you get something like this command does not exist then you might not downloaded python correctly.
If you have downloaded python correctly then do this:
For windows: Go to the dist folder and then to the python-bank folder and finally run python-bank.exe
For other platforms: Run on terminal python-bank.py
